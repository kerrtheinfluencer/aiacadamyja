# Futur4IsHere Mobile AI Academy

Ground-up rebuild of the mobile-first academy page.

## What works

- Premium mobile-friendly UI with clear "V4 Rebuild Active" marker.
- Module progression with auto-graded quiz (pass threshold: 3/4).
- Starter prompt remains locked until test pass.
- Live preview lab remains locked until test pass.
- Copy prompt and HTML preview tools unlock automatically after pass.
- **No localhost or backend server required** (single static HTML file).

## Run (No localhost required)

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (or mobile file browser).
3. If deploying to GitHub Pages, upload as-is; no server code needed.

## Deploy to GitHub

- Commit `index.html` and `README.md`.
- Push to GitHub.
- Optional: enable GitHub Pages to host the static file.
